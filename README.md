# SPTScrollViewExample

Example of using a `UIScrollView` **with AutoLayout**:

  * With *pagination* or *continuous scrolling*.
  * *Correctly* handling all of the orientations with consistent constraints (*without* both underconstraints and overconstraints).

## Description

If the scrollview is paginated, it's possible to also handle a UIPageControl to show the page numbering.

This solution uses the storyboard, accordingly with Apple best practices.

## How to use in your project

We've separated the usage example from the implementation, so **you just need to copy the category which defines all of the logic**.

You can take a look at the usage example to understand how to include the category in your own project.
